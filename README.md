# React shop demo with spring boot api
In this repo lies the source code for the demo React application as well as the Spring boot API.

## Getting started
1. First, you will need to clone or download the project on-to your local computer.
2. Open the ./webapp project in your favorite code editor/IDE for web development
3. Open file `./webapp/src/config.js` and set a correct link to the backend API for the variable `API_URL`. It must point to and address where your Spring boot backend is accessible.
4. Launch the webapp using:
    1. ```yarn install``` - To install the dependencies
    2. ```yarn start``` - To start the application
5. Open the ./api project in your favorite code editor/IDE for java development
6. Run the API with clicking the "play" button in the (most likely) upper right corner or use the ```mvn spring-boot:run``` command
